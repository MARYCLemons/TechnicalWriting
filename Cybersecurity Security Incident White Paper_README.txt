The Cybersecurity Security Incident White Paper.pdf is a sample white paper based
on the SolarWinds attack detected in December 2020.

I researched the attack out of personal interest.  It's a high level paper, intended for
non IT personnel to get a sense of the scope and seriousness of the attack.

Some specific material mentioned in the appendices, such as file hashes, are intentionally not included.
