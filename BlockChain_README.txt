When my organization acquired Storyline, I created the BlockChain.pdf as a get-acquainted
project.  This allowed me to learn the tool, and it also allowed other team members to
learn what could be done with an e-learning authoring tool.

I selected blockchain for the project specifically because we were not using that technology
in our own products.  I wanted the team to focus on using the course as an actual learner
would. 

This approach produced some great feedback and led to effective e-learning courses for our
learners.
